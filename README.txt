Having a hard time finding free 2d sprites with jumping and running animations online that I like so I put together something temporary (Super Mario 2 Style).

Player should control really well. He can wall jump (on a single wall or jump between walls)
He can also slide down walls(Parachute animation)

Can jump up from underneath allowed platforms // Fall through the same ones by pressing “S” or Down arrow(Orange Platforms)

Collect Kunai for points

I wasn’t sure what you wanted exactly with the reset on death so I made a splash Game Over Screen that allows you to reload the level or go to the High Score screen.

Controls:
WASD for moving
Left Shift for running
Space Bar to jump
